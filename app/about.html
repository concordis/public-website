          <h3>Brad Coulter</h3>
          <p>Taking a step away from the staffing consulting industry for several years to run a consumer Internet startup helped open my eyes to the power of transparency and authenticity. I asked myself why couldn’t the same powerful trends be applied to the staffing and consulting world. This idea or question is the genesis of Concordis and the resulting Shared Success model.</p>
          <p>I feel exceptionally lucky to have two founding partners in Tim and Brad, who share the same vision as me for a better way of doing business. Our model is so refreshing. I love that Concordis authentically aligns itself with the best interests of our contractors, consultants, and clients. By design, we can only grow professionally and financially if our consultants, contractors, and clients do, too.</p>
          <p>Full disclosure of rates, markups, and costs uniquely positions Concordis as a true partner to clients. When clients and consultants can see behind the curtain and have access to all of the data, everyone involved can make more informed decisions, from budgeting to hiring to professional development. It’s just a better way of doing business.</p>

          <h3>Tim Rogers</h3>
          <p>After 10 years in the employment industry, I felt the timing was right for a company like Concordis: full disclosure with bill and pay rates, no non-competes, and revenue sharing with internal staff and consultants. It almost sounds too good to be true, and that is why I’m excited to be a part of Concordis.</p>
          <p>One person rarely builds a company, which is why we believe all parties involved in building a company should be rewarded. It’s a unique, refreshing model that we truly believe is needed in the employment agency world. It’s time to start treating people how we would want to be treated.</p>
          <p>I look forward to working with clients and candidates to help build Concordis and give our clients and candidates an honest, open, trustworthy partner.</p>

          <h3>Brad Castoro</h3>
          <p>After a decade of various recruiting and leadership roles in the staffing industry, I was excited to be part of a team that aims to change the business with a shared methodology, a refreshing but simple premise: no more zero-sum gains. We only succeed when you succeed. Concordis was launched in early 2014 as a response to an ongoing want of more transparent, up-front contract recruitment practices.</p>
          <p>We wanted to create a new hiring ecosystem that starts with an open dialogue and consultant-first approach. Full disclosure of billing and respective pay rates, no non-competes, and standardized margins and revenue sharing. Yes, revenue sharing. If you help us build our business, you should share in the success.</p>
          <p>Thirty years of collective experience with countless consultants across varied industry segments taught us invaluable lessons. Our response to what was missing was to build a shared success model and remove conflict of interest. Treating people the way we would want to be treated is the ethos of Concordis.</p>
          <p>I wanted a model in which conversations with prospective field employees could focus on career trajectory, personal interests, and the right opportunities, not negotiation and head-scratching. More trust and more productivity me that we all win.</p>
