      <h1>Our Model of Shared Success</h1>
      <p>We only do better when our customers and our consultants do better. Let’s share that success. <b>Revenue sharing</b>, fully <b>disclosed bill rates</b>, comprehensive <b>benefits</b>, and an ongoing <b>feedback cycle</b> are a few perks our consultants enjoy. Concordis also offers <b>referral bonuses</b> and we never resort to non-compete agreements.</p>

          <dt><h3>Revenue sharing</h3></dt>
          <dd>Concordis sets aside 5% of its margin to pay its consultants a quarterly revenue share. Each share is based on a consultant’s tenure, bill rate, and <a href="http://www.workwithable.com/" target="_blank">Workwithable</a> Score.</dd>
          <dt><h3>Disclosed bill rates</h3></dt>
          <dd>We want it all out in the open. By using a standardized markup, Concordis can only earn more money for itself when the consultant earns more money. This is not the industry standard.</dd>

              <li><b>A Concordis-sourced deal</b>: When Concordis sets up a deal, it nets 25% for the first year of a consultant’s tenure. <i>E.g., assuming a $100 bill rate, $75 covers the consultant’s pay, their taxes, and the cost of their benefits. In this example, the consultant’s final pay rate is $66.50 after taxes of $6.19 and benefits costing $2.31.</i></li>
              <li><b>…after a year</b>: When a Concordis-sourced deal reaches its one-year anniversary, 80% is passed to the consultant. <i>E.g., assuming a $100 bill rate, $80 covers the consultant’s pay, their taxes, and the cost of their benefits. In this example, the consultant’s final pay rate is $71.09 after taxes of $6.60 and benefits costing $2.31.</i></li>
              <li><b>A consultant-sourced deal</b>: When a consultant sources their own deal, Concordis passes 80%. <i>E.g., assuming a $100 bill rate, $80 covers the consultant’s pay, their taxes, and the cost of their benefits.

      <h1>A Virtuous Cycle</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Work Engagement, Job Satisfaction, and Productivity—They’re a Virtuous Cycle.</p>
        <p>Engaged workers are more open to new information, more productive, and more willing to go the extra mile.</p>
        <p>Employees who are engaged in their work are fully connected to their work roles. They are bursting with energy, dedicated to their work, and immersed in their work activities.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Companies make money based on the spread between the bill rate and your pay rate, so they are incentivized to bill more and pay you less, creating a conflict of interest.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> eliminates this conflict of interest with standardized spreads.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Recruiters make more money when they talk you into being paid less.  Most recruiters are paid a percentage of the spread, the difference between the bill rate and your pay rate. This reinforces the conflict of interest.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> eliminates this conflict of interest with standardized spreads and pays our internal staff flat fees based on the bill rate. This means the only way a recruiter, a sales person, or Concordis makes more money is if you do also. We’re aligned with you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Your ability or inability to negotiate and play the game often determines your pay rate. This is why companies make up the difference on low spread deals with high spread deals and consultants doing the exact same job can have hugely varying pay rates.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> consultants all receive the same deal. No games played.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If the company won’t show you the bill rate, then you know something isn’t right. Hiding the bill rate typically indicates a large spread between the bill rate and the pay rate.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> always discloses the bill rate.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="industry-secrets">
            <li>
              <p>Company sponsored health insurance isn’t that great because even when the company is “paying” for it, you’re actually paying for it with your rate.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> is in the same boat as the other guys with this one. We could pay higher rates by not offering health insurance, but we believe taking care of increasingly more confusing health insurance options serves our consultants’ interests.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Non-compete agreements are used to intimidate you from leaving and they’re typically not enforceable (check with your attorney).</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> does not use non-compete agreements. Work with us because you want to, not because we had you sign some piece of paper.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you’re on a contract for more than a year, then most of the value the company provided by sourcing the original contract is gone. This means you have the leverage and should be paid more of the bill rate.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> passes 80% of the bill rate to you automatically on your one-year anniversary with the same manager.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You have more leverage than you think.</p>
              <p><b>Concordis</b> recognizes this and treats consultants as true partners. Many companies say this but we put our money where our mouth is with revenue sharing and professional development.</p>
